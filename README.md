# multirepo-core

An example repository to demonstrate how to use a GitHub action to copy files to another repository on each push.

Can be used to have DS maintainers push to one 'Core' repository while DS consumers use a dedicated 'Theme' repository - but still benefit from tokens that maintainers push to the 'Core' repository.
